# Bootstrap

This is a CSS and Bootstrap Responsive Portofolio:

This web application renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.  As a developer, I have created a mobile-first application or added a responsive design to this existing applicaiton.  

I have created the following files: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.

Using Bootstrap, I have developed my own sample portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   * A sticky footer and sub-rows and sub-columns

This website is created with Bootstrap and consist of 3 pages onto it.
